<h1>AJ's RECOMMENDED MOVIES</h1>
<h2>The Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Machinist</h3>
<p>Dark, surreal with the added hint of Schizophrenic twist<br/>
One of the best underrated Bale performances of all time</p>
<h3>Inglorious Basterds</h3>
<p>What happens if you were to change one of the darkest <br/> aspects of history and give it a Tarantino twist.<br/>Hint: Lots of Nazis get massacred</p>
<h3>Taxi Driver</h3>
<p>A truly Scorsese Classic with a backhanded commentary<br/>on exisentialism, PTSD, and vigilantism. A must watch<br/>Definitely De Niro's finest performace according to me.</p>
